### Comments on the task

This calculator should follow all given specifications!

But unfortunately, I noticed this job advert on 29th of January, which was 2 days before the deadline. Due to this,
I've decided to drop out a lot of functionality and skip some general quality of life. Given more time I would have:
- split everything into components
- better UI work
- more tests
- made more failsafes (currently negative values are not disabled and NaN values may appear)
- general accessibility improvements
- (MAYBE) contain all inputs in a form and adding error messages for invalid/missing inputs
